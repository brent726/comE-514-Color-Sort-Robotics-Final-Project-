# comE-514-Color-Sort-Robotics-Final-Project-

This is an RGB Color Sort using Lynx 5 robotic arm with the ssc 32 microcontroller

For the image processing (done with opencv):
imageProcessing.cpp and .h



For the movement of the robot:

robotSupport.cpp and .h - core functions that are needed in moving the robot
robotMotion.cpp and .h - I think this is not needed anymore (disregard the description in the comment portion)
robotMove.cpp and .h - calls robotSupport Function
serialComm.cpp and .h - for the connection of the hardware and software

Main method:
Project.cpp
